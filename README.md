This is a small and internal (private) repo containing handy scripts for the use of the jupyter.kitegg.de jupyterlabs server.

Jakob has set it up to store own scripts online and easily accessible, but you are welcome to contribute your own scripts or use the existing.



# Conventions

- describe what the script does in the header of the file
- note author and date in the header
- use `git update-index --chmod=+x` + `filename/path` to make files immedieately executable when being cloned...
